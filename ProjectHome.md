an application that is used to control and find an hardware that we attach to keys,children etc.

we built the hardware which is base on ArduinoBT.

in the application there are 4 features:

1) finding the hardware by voice(make it beep/ make it chirp).

2)finding the hardware by an hot-cold game, with a nice view- as much as you close to the hardware the screen became more red, there is also a legend of colors and estimated distance from the hardware.

3)safe-mode : when the hardware is not anymore in the bluetooth reception area , there is a message alert for the user

4)putting the owners details in the hardware so the finder can get them out.
